On Linux:
  Just edit package.json and run `npm run publish_build` seems to work
On Windows:
  Using nvs, run
    nvs_shell
    nvs use v14.9.0
    npm run publish_build
      This built for v14 and cached the result, but failed to build v16
    nvs use v16.13.0
    npm run publish_build
      This build for v16
    and so on up through v22.11.0
Also have Python version issues, run `py2shell` if Gyp throws errors
